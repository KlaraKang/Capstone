    <div class="left_s" style="padding-top: 10px;">
      <h2 style="font-size: 12px;">The school quality report uses six framework elements to organize and share 
          the percent positive data from the school quality review and survey results:<br><br>
          1. Rigorous Instruction: How well the curriculum and instruction engage students
          and build critical-thinking skills.<br><br> 
          2. Collaborative Teachers: How well teachers participate in opportunities to develop, 
          grow, and contribute to the continuous improvement of the school community.<br><br> 
          3. Supportive Environment:  How well the school establishes a culture where students 
          feel safe, challenged to grow, and supported to meet high expectations.<br><br>
          4. Effective School Leadership: How well school leadership inspires the school community
          with a clear instructional vision and effectively distributes leadership to realize this vision.<br><br>
          5. Strong Family-Community Ties: How well the school forms effective partnerships with 
          families to improve the school.<br><br>
          6. Trust:  Whether the relationships between administrators, educators, students, and families
          are based on trust and respect.<br><br>
