      <h4>The NYC School Quality Review and The School Survey Results (Year 2021-22)</h4>
      <div class="left_s" style="padding-top: 5%;">
         <h2 style="font-size: 14px;">The school quality report uses six framework elements to organize and share 
            the percent positive data from the school quality review and survey results:<br><br>
            1. Rigorous Instruction: How well the curriculum and instruction engage students
             and build critical-thinking skills.<br><br> 
            2. Collaborative Teachers: How well teachers participate in opportunities to develop, 
            grow, and contribute to the continuous improvement of the school community.<br><br> 
            3. Supportive Environment:  How well the school establishes a culture where students 
            feel safe, challenged to grow, and supported to meet high expectations.<br><br>
            4. Effective School Leadership: How well school leadership inspires the school community
            with a clear instructional vision and effectively distributes leadership to realize this vision.<br><br>
            5. Strong Family-Community Ties: How well the school forms effective partnerships with 
            families to improve the school.<br><br>
            6. Trust:  Whether the relationships between administrators, educators, students, and families
            are based on trust and respect.<br><br>
